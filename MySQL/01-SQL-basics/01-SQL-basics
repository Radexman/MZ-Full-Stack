# **SQL Basics**

Data base is a logically structured collection of data as tables with realtions between them.

Data bases examples:

-   Phone book
-   Library catalogue
-   Facebook users

Data base is made of tables and tables are made of rows and columns.

Record (tuple) - is a single row in table, it contains a set of fields. Just like in Excel. Record doesn't need to contain full row.

Field (attribute) - part of the table that contains single piece of data.

Primary key - also known as main key, it is one or multiple fields which contents identifies for each recors in the table. This feature is called key unqueness.

Redundation - unnecessary case of repeating already existing data or task.

## **PHPMyAdmin**

DBMS - Database Managemnt System

A_I - Automatic increment, increments int by 1 each time.

## **SQL**

SQL - Structured Query Language.

Query - inquiery for database.

Types of queries

-   inserting
-   searching
-   changing
-   deleting
-   changing the structure of table or database

Logical operators in SQL

AND - when both conditions are true.
OR - when at least one condition is true.

In MySQL we use relational data bases. In this model we divide data into tables and define fields which are called keys. Next we define relations between tables in logical order.

Relation - logical connection occuring between tablse realised by krimary key and foreign key or special connecting table. Each relation is described by type.

Relation types:

-   one-to-one
-   one-to-many
-   many-to-many

Data Types - in each column in the table we store only one data type.

Query in SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pytania WHERE id = 15
```

-   SELECT - choose
-   '\*'- all columns
-   FROM - from table
-   pytania - named
-   WHERE - where
-   id = 15 - this condition occurs

### **Sorting**

Sorting is the process of ordering records by some kind of criteria. Criteria is name or names of fields. For example sorting can be ascending or descending.

Sorting in SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pytania ORDER BY tresc ASC
```
