# **PHP Basics**

PHP - Personal Home Page

MVC (Model-View-Controller) - architectural framework used for organising web page structure in concise way.

Apostrophe vs Quotations

1. Between apostrophs $ operator doesn't work':

```php
echo 'Hello, $name'; // output: Hello, $name
```

2. Between apostrophs we can use quotations:

```php
echo '<img src="picture.jpg" />';
```

3. For concatenation in PHP we use dot operator:

```php
$name = 'Emilia'
echo $name.', hello!' // output: Emilia, hello!
```
